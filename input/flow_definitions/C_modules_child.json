For example, it may feel boring to pick up toys after having fun or ending a big task. \n\n\n✨Ask your child to do something else, and distract them before the unwanted behaviour begins or gets worse. \n\n\n✨Invite Your Child in a chore you are doing. You can ask Your Child to think of a fun and quick way of doing the chores differently. \n\n\n💡 This is much easier than using consequences after they do something!",
